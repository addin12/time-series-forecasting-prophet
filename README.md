# Time Series Forecasting for Sales Projection using Retail Store Data

## Why Projecting Sales ?
- Projecting includes as an important business activity for evaluating the expected performance of alternative business plans, especially in order to predict sales, margin or market shares.
- By knowing the near future estimated value of sales based on the value we define, we could determine the best action of maintaining the outcome of our sales performance.

## Project Overview

### Background
>Client wants to know how their retail store sales performance in the future. Is it match their expectation ?

### Objectives
>Determine their sales projection for next 3 months.
 
### Scope
> - Metrics used on this project : Sales, Member, Quantity, and COGS
> - Data Period : 01 May 2018 - 26 November 2022 (Approximately 5 Years).

## Project Workflow
There are some steps that needs to build forecasting model :
